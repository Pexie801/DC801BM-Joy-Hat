# DC801BM-Joy-Hat
Stick ends for the DC801 Black Mage badge.

Printed on Prusa Mini at .2 Layer hight, Prusamint PLA. I sugest using some hair spray to help it adhear when printing more then 1 set at a time. These would prob come out a lot better on a SLA or SLS printer due to the size. They tent to fit a bit tight but this can be down to your print settings. It's hard with FDM to get them to fit 100% all the time due to veriation in filiment, printer, layer hight.
